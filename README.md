#Possible title [platform-game]
A platform game with 2 player multiplayer support

##About this game
This is a archive-export from eclipse, so it can be edited by your likes

When opened, it will ask you whether to run a server or not. When pressed yes, you will become a host [others have to press no in order to join someone on a local network]

Feel free to enter any name you like [can even be left blank]

##Controls
Use the arrow keys to walk

>More wil be added in further updates [maybe jumping?]

##Known bugs
When you walk to the edge of the world and loose focus on the window, the text will be positioned wrong

>Need to find a better way than using the x-, and yOffset of the player to position the not-focused-text

When more than 2 instances [one being host] run, the connection system to the host will mess up

>Need to rewrite the multiplayer system, so that it allows multiple connections
